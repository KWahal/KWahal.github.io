## Research
- I have been working with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home) since December 2021 to study how the extremism of winning candidates differs between a ranked-choice voting system and the current primary system. I write mathematical proofs to verify our results and simulated the two voting systems across any number of voters, candidates, and vote distributions using Python. Our paper is currently under construction. 
- I have been working with Stanford GSB Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html) at the [State and Local Governance Institute](https://www.hoover.org/focus-areas/empowering-state-and-local-governance) since July 2022, studying the relationship between state and local debt structures and bond yield curves. I conduct data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations on state financial statements from 2002 to 2021 using Python. 
- From November 2021 to January 2022, I worked with Stanford Ph.D. student [Garrett Adler](https://earth.stanford.edu/events/e-iper-dissertation-defense-garrett-albistegui-adler-social-order-and-social-protection#gs.cpmwy4) to study the role of a social safety net policy in mitigating climate stressors. 
- In January 2021, I published "[Predicting Orbital Resonance of 2867 Å teins Using the Yarkovsky Effect](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/articles/predicting-orbital-resonance-of-2867-steins-using-the-yarkovsky-effect/pdf)," an original physics research paper, in the Journal of Emerging Investigators.
