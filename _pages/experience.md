## Internships
- Since January 2023, I have been working in the [Office of Domestic Finance](https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/domestic-finance) (specifically, the [Office of Consumer Policy](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/consumer-policy)) at the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/). I help research the impact of economic policy choices on Americans household finances. 
- Since July 2022, I have been working with [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/) (EPIC), a nonprofit founded by [Michael Tubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs) using academic research, first-hand perspectives of low-income communities, and lobbying to advance transformative policies on poverty. I assist EPIC Chief of Staff Devon Gray by researching poverty-related policy issues, tracking legislation, and studying the causes of poverty in California.
- From June 2022 to August 2022, I worked in Washington, D.C. in the Economic Analysis Division of the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency focused on reducing poverty through economic growth. I used Stata to clean [Afrobarometer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/) survey data, develop a cross-sectional pooled dataset, and assist with constraint analyses. I also worked on MCC's Indonesia Compact. I was mentored by [Francis Fukuyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama).
- From March 2022 to June 2022, I served as a Legislative Intern for U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) (D-OR). I wrote policy memos and constituent letters on housing, labor, gun control, immigration, and poverty, and sorted Senate mail.

## Research
- Since December 2021, I have been working with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home) to co-author a paper analyzing how the extremism of winning candidates differs between a ranked-choice voting system and the current primary system. I write mathematical proofs to verify our results and simulated the two voting systems across any number of voters, candidates, and vote distributions using Python. 
- From July 2022 to October 2022, I worked with Stanford GSB Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html) at the [State and Local Governance Institute](https://www.hoover.org/focus-areas/empowering-state-and-local-governance) to study the relationship between state and local debt structures and bond yield curves. I conducted data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations on state financial statements from 2002 to 2021 using Python. I also helped train a machine learning model to analyze financial documents.
- From November 2021 to January 2022, I worked with Stanford Ph.D. student [Garrett Adler](https://earth.stanford.edu/events/e-iper-dissertation-defense-garrett-albistegui-adler-social-order-and-social-protection#gs.cpmwy4) to study the role of a social safety net policy in mitigating climate stressors. 
- In January 2021, I co-published "[Predicting Orbital Resonance of 2867 Å teins Using the Yarkovsky Effect](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/articles/predicting-orbital-resonance-of-2867-steins-using-the-yarkovsky-effect/pdf)," an original physics research paper, in the Journal of Emerging Investigators. 

## Extracurriculars & Leadership
- From July 2020 to January 2023, I managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a national nonprofit dedicated to providing detailed and consolidated local election information for Americans. I co-founded the organization in Arizona, where it received 20,000 page views in the week prior to the November 2020 election. Since then, I've expanded The Polling Place to include 300+ applicants from 25+ states. Our team has conducted research on thousands of political candidates, and in the month leading up to the November 2022 midterm elections, our website received over 100,000 page views. We've also been featured by the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/11/03/metro/newton-south-students-work-bring-polling-place-massachusetts/) and [Arizona Capitol Times](https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2020/10/22/too-young-to-vote-but-not-too-young-to-inform-voters/) (among others), worked with [national partners](https://www.peacefirst.org/home) like Georgetown University's [Institute of Politics](https://politics.georgetown.edu/) and [PeaceFirst](https://www.peacefirst.org/home), raised $7,000+, redesigned our website, and received 500,000+ page views and 105,000+ unique visitors to date. I currently serve in an advisory capacity.
