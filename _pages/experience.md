## Research
- Since December 2021, I have been working with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home) to co-author a paper analyzing how the extremism of winning candidates differs between a ranked-choice voting system and the current primary system. I write mathematical proofs to verify our results and simulated the two voting systems across any number of voters, candidates, and vote distributions using Python. Our paper is currently under construction. 
- Since July 2022, I have been working with Stanford GSB Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html) at the [State and Local Governance Institute](https://www.hoover.org/focus-areas/empowering-state-and-local-governance), studying the relationship between state and local debt structures and bond yield curves. I conduct data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations on state financial statements from 2002 to 2021 using Python. 
- From November 2021 to January 2022, I worked with Stanford Ph.D. student [Garrett Adler](https://earth.stanford.edu/events/e-iper-dissertation-defense-garrett-albistegui-adler-social-order-and-social-protection#gs.cpmwy4) to study the role of a social safety net policy in mitigating climate stressors. 
- In January 2021, I co-published "[Predicting Orbital Resonance of 2867 Å teins Using the Yarkovsky Effect](https://www.emerginginvestigators.org/articles/predicting-orbital-resonance-of-2867-steins-using-the-yarkovsky-effect/pdf)," an original physics research paper, in the Journal of Emerging Investigators. 

## Internships
- Since July 2022, I have been working with [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/), a nonprofit founded by [Michael Tubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs) using academic research, first-hand perspectives of low-income communities, and lobbying to advance transformative policies on poverty. I assist EPIC Chief of Staff Devon Gray by researching poverty-related policy issues, tracking legislation, and studying the causes of poverty in California.
- From June 2022 to August 2022, I served as an Econoimc Analysis Intern for the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency focused on reducing poverty through economic growth. I used Stata to clean [Afrobarometer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/) survey data, develop a cross-sectional pooled dataset, and assist with constraint analyses. I also worked on MCC's Indoensia Compact. I was mentored by [Francis Fukuyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama).
- From March 2022 to June 2022, I served as a Legislative Intern for U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/) (D-OR). I wrote policy memos and constituent letters on housing, labor, gun control, immigration, and poverty, and sorted Senate mail.
- From January 2022 to March 2022, I interned for CA State Senator Josh Becker. I assisted Sen. Becker with policy research in weekly one-on-one meetings, focusing on employee stock ownership and California welfare programs.

## Leadership
- Since July 2020, I have managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a national nonprofit dedicated to providing detailed, consolidated local election information for Americans. I co-founded the organization in Arizona, where it received 20,000 page views in the week prior to the November election. Since then, I've expanded The Polling Place to include 300+ applicants from 25+ states. Our team has conducted research on thousands of political candidates, been featured by the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/11/03/metro/newton-south-students-work-bring-polling-place-massachusetts/) and [Arizona Capitol Times](https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2020/10/22/too-young-to-vote-but-not-too-young-to-inform-voters/) (among others), worked with [national partners](https://www.peacefirst.org/home) like Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and PeaceFirst, raised $7,000+, redesigned our website, and received 320,000+ page views and 56,000+ unique visitors to date.
