Hi! I’m Karsen, a junior at Stanford pursuing a B.A. in economics, B.S. in computer science with a specialization in AI, minor in math, and M.S. in statistics. I’m interested in leveraging economics and data science to alleviate poverty and improve policy.

Currently, I'm working as a data science intern for [Propel](https://www.joinpropel.com/), a startup that developed Providers, a free app used by over 5 million across the country to [help](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/us/politics/safety-net-apps-tech.html) Americans with low income manage their government benefits and their money. I’m also co-authoring a game theory paper on ranked-choice voting with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home), and helping out with side-projects for [Michael Tubbs's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs) nonprofit [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/). Previously, I worked for the U.S. Treasury Department's [Office of Domestic Finance](https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/domestic-finance), U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html), California State Senator [Josh Becker](https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/), and the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency. I founded and managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a nonprofit organization with over 300 applicants and 500,000 page views, that provides information on local candidates running for office; I now serve in an advisory role. 

On campus, I’m the Vice Chair of Fellowships and Stipends for [Stanford in Government](https://sig.stanford.edu/), where I oversee $550,000 and the placement of over 80 students into fully-funded policy internships, including the World Bank, FCC, DOD, and Congressional offices. I'm also a Residential Assistant in [Otero](https://resed.stanford.edu/neighborhood-t/hyperion-t-houses/wilbur-otero), Stanford’s Public Service and Civic Engagement (PSCE) Theme House, and a staff writer for the [Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/). Previously, I served as a [Cardinal Service Peer Advisor](https://haas.stanford.edu/resources/students/advising), where I spearheaded efforts to support public service, and as the managing editor of the [Stanford Economic Review](https://stanfordeconreview.com/), the leading undergraduate economics journal. I've taken graduate-level coursework in [machine learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/), [natural language processing](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), [artificial intelligence](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/spring2023/), and [statistical inference](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=stats200&collapse=), as well as undergraduate coursework in [advanced econometrics](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=econ102c&collapse=), [market design](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=econ136&collapse=), [algorithm design](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs161/), [matrix theory](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20222023&q=MATH104%3A+Applied+Matrix+Theory&collapse=), and [decision modeling](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=econ137&collapse=).

In my free time, you can catch me taking road trips with friends, hiking, reading, listening to podcasts with [Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/by/ezra-klein) and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), and playing with my dog. Feel free to reach out at kwahal@stanford.edu!
