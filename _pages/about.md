Hi! I'm Karsen, a senior at Stanford pursuing a B.A. in economics, B.S. in math, and M.S. in computer science with a specialization in AI. I'm broadly interested in answering big questions in economics and policy, and I'm advised by Professors [Pete Klenow](http://www.klenow.com/) and [Nicholas Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/).

Currently, I'm co-authoring a monetary policy paper with [Dr. Kinda Hachem](https://sites.google.com/site/kindahachem/home) at the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/) and a game theory [paper](https://bit.ly/RCVPaper) on ranked-choice voting with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home). I also work with Professors [Isaac Sorkin](https://sites.google.com/site/isaacsorkin/home) and [Lihua Lei](https://lihualei71.github.io/), and am a Teaching Assistant for introductory economics with Pete Klenow. On campus, I'm a Residential Assistant in the [Public Service House](https://resed.stanford.edu/neighborhoods/neighborhood-resources/neighborhood-concept/theme-housing/university-theme-houses-1-5), an [Economics Peer Advisor](https://economics.stanford.edu/undergraduate/peer-advising), and a [National Advisory Board Member](https://haas.stanford.edu/about/our-people-0/national-advisory-board) for the Haas Center for Public Service. 

In the past, I've worked for the public interest tech startup [Propel](https://www.joinpropel.com/), the US Treasury [Department](https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/domestic-finance), [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/), U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html), and the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency.  I founded and managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a nonprofit with over 600,000 page views, that provides information on local candidates running for office; I now serve in an advisory role. I've taken graduate-level coursework in microeconomics, machine learning, market design, labor economics, natural language processing, graph theory, causal inference, convex optimization, and statistics/econometrics.

In my free time, you can catch me climbing mountains, taking road trips with friends, reading Substacks, and playing with my dog. Feel free to reach out at kwahal@stanford.edu!
