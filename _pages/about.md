Hi! I’m Karsen, a sophomore at Stanford University, studying economics, computer science (AI), and statistics. I’m interested in leveraging quantitative skills and technology to alleviate poverty, improve economic policy, and strengthen institutions.

Currently, I'm working in the [Office of Consumer Policy](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/consumer-policy) at the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/). I’m also co-authoring a game theory paper on ranked-choice voting with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home). Previously, I worked for [Michael Tubbs's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs) nonprofit [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/), U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html), California State Senator [Josh Becker](https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/), and the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency. I founded and managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a nonprofit organization with over 300 applicants and 500,000 page views, that provides information on local candidates running for office; since January 2023, I have served in an advisory role. 

On campus, I’m Stanford’s youngest [Cardinal Service Peer Advisor](https://haas.stanford.edu/resources/students/advising), where I help spearhead efforts to support public service. I’m the managing editor of the [Stanford Economic Review](https://stanfordeconreview.com/), a leading undergraduate economics journal. I’m also the Director of National Fellowships for [Stanford in Government](https://sig.stanford.edu/), where I organize 13 fully-funded national public service internships, and I’m a staff writer for the [Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/). 

In my free time, you can catch me reading [books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/karsenwahal), journaling about my thoughts on politics, listening to podcasts with [Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/by/ezra-klein) and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), playing with my dog, hiking, and traveling.
