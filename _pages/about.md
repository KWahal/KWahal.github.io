Hi! I’m Karsen, a sophomore at Stanford University, studying Economics, Computer Science, and Statistics. I’m interested in leveraging quantitative skills and technology to increase the efficiency of government policy and operations, with a specific focus on poverty, economic policy, and institutions.

Currently, I’m co-authoring a game theory paper on ranked-choice voting with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home). I’m also working for [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/), a nonprofit organization founded by [Michael Tubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs). Previously, I worked for U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html), California State Senator [Josh Becker](https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/), and the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency. I founded and continue to manage [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a nonprofit organization with over 300 applicants and 500,000 page views, that provides information on local candidates running for office. 

On campus, I’m Stanford’s youngest [Cardinal Service Peer Advisor](https://haas.stanford.edu/resources/students/advising), where I help spearhead efforts to support public service. I’m the managing editor of the [Stanford Economic Review](https://stanfordeconreview.com/), a leading undergraduate economics journal. I’m also the Director of National Fellowships for [Stanford in Government](https://sig.stanford.edu/), where I organize 13 fully-funded national public service internships, and I’m a staff writer for the [Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/). 

In my free time, you can catch me journaling about my thoughts on politics, reading blogs by [Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/by/ezra-klein) and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), playing with my dog, hiking, and traveling. Feel free to reach out at kwahal@stanford.edu.
