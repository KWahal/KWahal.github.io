Hi! I’m Karsen, a junior at Stanford pursuing a B.A. with honors in economics, B.S. in computer science with a specialization in AI, minor in math, and M.S. in statistics. I’m interested in leveraging economics and data science to improve public policy and alleviate poverty.

Currently, I'm co-authoring a game theory [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYXQWo0LX-ujtZSTNTUaJO9De9gbTnZU/view) on ranked-choice voting with Professor [Avidit Acharya](https://www.aviditacharya.com/home), and helping out with side-projects for [Michael Tubbs's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tubbs) nonprofit [End Poverty in California](https://endpovertyinca.org/). Previously, I worked as a data science intern for [Propel](https://www.joinpropel.com/), a startup that developed Providers, a free app to [help](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/us/politics/safety-net-apps-tech.html) over 5 million low-income Americans manage their government benefits and their money. I also worked for the U.S. Treasury Department's [Office of Domestic Finance](https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/domestic-finance), U.S. Senator [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor [Joshua Rauh](https://web.stanford.edu/~rauh/index.html), California State Senator [Josh Becker](https://sd13.senate.ca.gov/), and the [Millennium Challenge Corporation](https://www.mcc.gov/), a federal aid agency. I founded and managed [The Polling Place](https://thepollingplace.org/), a nonprofit organization with over 300 applicants and 500,000 page views, that provides information on local candidates running for office; I now serve in an advisory role. 

On campus, I’m the Vice Chair of Fellowships and Stipends for [Stanford in Government](https://sig.stanford.edu/), where I oversee $550,000 and the placement of over 80 students into fully-funded policy internships, including the World Bank, FCC, DOD, and Congressional offices. I'm also a Residential Assistant in [Otero](https://resed.stanford.edu/neighborhood-t/hyperion-t-houses/wilbur-otero), Stanford’s Public Service and Civic Engagement (PSCE) Theme House, a staff writer for the [Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/), and serve on the [National Advisory Board](https://haas.stanford.edu/about/our-people-0/national-advisory-board) for the Haas Center for Public Service. I've taken graduate-level coursework in machine learning, market design, labor economics, natural language processing, causal inference, convex optimization, and statistics/econometrics.

In my free time, you can catch me climbing mountains, taking road trips with friends, reading, listening to podcasts with [Ezra Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/by/ezra-klein) and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), and playing with my dog. Feel free to reach out at kwahal@stanford.edu!
